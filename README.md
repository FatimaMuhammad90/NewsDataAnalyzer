# NewsDataAnalyzer
A python webscraping project that uses top pakistani news sources to analyze data based on various parameter.
This project utilises the basic python webscrapping tool i.e. beautifulsoup and requests. Data is gathered from the front page of the news site, thus gaining the most popular and breaking news that is important to Pakistanis, at the moment. Words occuring in news are mapped using matplotlib and plotly libraries. Geographical heatmap containing location of incidents that are popular on the news are mapped using a free geocoder tool associated with python. Follium is used to create a map in an html to represent the location of the affected area. Matplotlib and plotly libraries are once again used to create pie charts of senimental anaylsis of news whether positive, neutral or negative or reported in the day or not.
